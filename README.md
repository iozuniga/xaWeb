xaWeb is a new development platform that allows you to quickly and easily create management applications for Web environments and Windows and Linux operating systems using only the Harbour development environment.

The demo version is fully functional and includes the same source code as the commercial version, which is 90% of the entire xaWeb code. Its only limitation is that it can only be used for small projects.

xaWeb is based on CGI technology for creating dynamic content web pages. CGI technology has significant advantages over other script-based development environments, such as:

- Speed, since it is compiled code.

- Security, since it prevents the execution of scripts that a hacker may have uploaded to our server.

- Safeguarding the developer’s intellectual property rights by not having to host any source code on the web server, only the executable.
xaWeb aims to achieve the following objectives:

1) Ensure that any Harbour user becomes productive from day one and sees no significant programming differences between the desktop environment and xaWeb.

2) Preventing any limitations on the programmer’s access to any functionality of the tool. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

3) Automatic, two-way data transfer between web pages created with xaWeb and the CGI application without the developer having to do anything to make this communication mechanism work.

4) The exact same code creates applications for Windows and Linux.

xaWeb is simply a few Harbour libraries that you use the same way you would any other Harbour library. You can link them using Harbour’s HBMK2 tool, but we recommend using the Xailer IDE as it provides significant advantages.
