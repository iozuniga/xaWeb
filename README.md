# xaWeb
xaWeb is a new development platform that allows you to quickly and easily create management applications for Web environments and Windows and Linux operating systems using only the Harbour development environment.

The demo version is fully functional and includes the same source code as the commercial version, which is 90% of the entire xaWeb code. Its only limitation is that it can only be used for small projects.

xaWeb is based on CGI technology for creating dynamic content web pages. CGI technology has significant advantages over other script-based development environments, such as:

- Speed, since it is compiled code.

- Security, since it prevents the execution of scripts that a hacker may have uploaded to our server.

- Safeguarding the developer’s intellectual property rights by not having to host any source code on the web server, only the executable.
xaWeb aims to achieve the following objectives:

1) Ensure that any Harbour user becomes productive from day one and sees no significant programming differences between the desktop environment and xaWeb.

2) Preventing any limitations on the programmer’s access to any functionality of the tool. HTML, JavaScript, and CSS.

3) Automatic, two-way data transfer between web pages created with xaWeb and the CGI application without the developer having to do anything to make this communication mechanism work.

4) The exact same code creates applications for Windows and Linux.

xaWeb is simply a few Harbour libraries that you use the same way you would any other Harbour library. You can link them using Harbour’s HBMK2 tool, but we recommend using the Xailer IDE as it provides significant advantages.

# License, support and updates:
The license is perpetual and includes updates and support for one year. The user may, if desired, contract with OZ Software to renew support and updates for additional periods. The cost of this renewal is 50% of the product price at the time of renewal. Non-renewal means that you will have to purchase the full product if you decide to upgrade to the latest version of xaWeb in the future. OZ Software will send you a message with sufficient time to ensure you can upgrade in time.

# Linux
Linux is xaWeb’s preferred environment, as the most widely used web servers are mostly Linux.

xaWeb has been developed under the Ubuntu Linux environment and Apache2 server, but it should have no problems with other operating systems and web servers. Harbour is the tool that truly offers this powerful compatibility.

For development with xaWeb, we recommend using the Xailer IDE, which only works under Windows. Therefore, we recommend installing WSL to work together with both environments. WSL will give you the ability to compile Harbour applications from within Xailer itself and even display web pages created with a local Apache2 installation that you can integrate into WSL.

# Windows
Windows is also supported by xaWeb, as expected, and for many users it will be the preferred option thanks to the ability to access necessary external resources. xaWeb has been successfully tested on the following servers:

- Apache server
- Microsoft IIS
- Sambar WebServer
- Orelly Website
  
For development with xaWeb, we recommend the Xailer IDE, which also offers CGI debugging capabilities.

# Requirements
- Operating system: Windows 10/11.
- Processor: Intel i5 or higher.
- RAM: Minimum 8 GB (16 GB recommended).
- Storage: SSD with at least 10 GB free.
- Compiler Harbour.
- Xailer 9.2 or Visual Studio Code + extensions for Harbor.
- Version control tool such as GitHub or Svn version control.
- WSL (Linux)
